</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>So it's been about 2 months since my last post. In my defence it's not really my fault, I'll get into that below.</p>
<h2>I moved!</h2>
<p>A big part of the reason I haven't been posting is because I've been in the process of moving. I will miss the old place, I posted a semi-long status on facebook talking about it, I wont really repeat it here, I'll just say after living there for near on 5 years I grew really used to the place, I'm really beginning to settle into the new place, I can find myself around with the lights off and that's how I know I've basically got it down pat :)</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Work's been quite good. Quite stressful with a lot of the ongoing projects, but good none the less. Having my two interns helping me with it</p>
<h2>Personal Development</h2>
<p>Stuff about lisp and arithmetic shift</p>
<h2>Shows I'm currently watching</h2>
<p>House, Andromeda</p>
<h2>Game night</h2>
<p>end of only war</p>
<h3>Thanks for reading, I'll catchya next time :)</h3>                </article>
