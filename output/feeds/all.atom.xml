&lt;p&gt;So I took a bit of a break from these posts, that's mostly because not a lot extra has been happening, and it's the whole "if you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all" and I guess I've applied good to also apply to interesting/insightful, I don't have much to add for this post, but I feel I should at least put something out there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Socialising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's again, been a relatively quiet couple of weeks for me by the normal definition of socialising. I did however have a friend of mine from high school move in with my wife and I. The three of us will be moving into a house sometime in the new year, not too far from where we currently are which is pretty convenient, it'll be a longer walk to the bus/train station and the nearest shops, but that being said it'd be pretty hard to match where we currently are in that regard, it's probably honestly one of the best places to live as a broke uni student without a car location wise, there's not even that many options on uber eats around our place, but yeah, that should be pretty good I think, We'll all go from being pretty cramped to having more space than what we know what to do with (Maybe, probably not, but well see)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also took my two interns out for a kind of Christmas/Thank you lunch thing. The entire office had a Christmas in late November, but this was specifically for them as I felt that it would be a good way to show my appreciation to them. I guess it's also a part of my personal creed sort of thing that anyone who could be considered an "underling" (Sorry to either of my interns if you happen to read this) I need to take personal responsibility for. I've been working on giving them more autonomy and for them more to come to me when they have a problem, but I think I find it more interesting to see how they approach problems and to be immediately available if I'm needed, not that I don't like coding something myself or have an aversion or anything along those lines, I just like being somewhat of an in-house consultant I guess. Knowing how or at least having an understanding of how all the different bits mesh together, the limitations and future scope etc. but also being able to jump in and do some coding myself where it's needed I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also been a couple of game nights too, I might go into detail of them one of these days, not this one though. I have finally managed to develop my current character a bit though, which is always good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and while I'm writing this I'm in the car next to my wife on the way down south, to catch up with that group of mates and family and whatnot. I'll be back up in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much else to say on work, just been finalising some ongoing projects that have been in development for a while and making sure the platform was rock solid before going on break over Christmas, the longest continuous break that I would've had in about 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal Development &amp;amp; Leisure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've finally done a bit of mucking about with lisp again, a touch of hylang, nothing substantial still. I've started rewriting the CSSC sign up page to use Django in place of PHP. I might do some stuff with Flask in the next week or two, I guess it's the thing of too much to do, not enough time to do it all. I've packed up my computer since my friend moved in with us, so I haven't gone back to Axiom Verge, I have been playing a bit of Super Smash Brothers with her though as she has a switch and all that. PD is still what I mostly do in my spare time though&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This Blog &amp;amp; Hot Takes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still to properly make the changes to the theme for this blog, but that's okay, I'll get there eventually. I am thinking of more or less writing a full year review for 2018 and posting that to this blog, but that probably wont happen until early next year too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not really any hot takes for the last little while either&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thanks for reading, I'll catchya next time :)&lt;/h3&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>More ramblings to the void</title><link href="https://anton.savill.id.au/more-ramblings-to-the-void.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-09T21:50:00+08:00</published><updated>2018-12-09T21:50:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Anton Savill</name></author><id>tag:anton.savill.id.au,2018-12-09:/more-ramblings-to-the-void.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Week ending 9th of December 2018&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I was thinking about it, writing this stuff, even if nobody reads it, is probably a good thing, right? Like it's basically a diary and whatnot, and I feel like I read somewhere sometime that jotting down your thoughts was supposed to help, that obviously comes with a metric ton of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I will say though is I'm writing this a few days after the published date of this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Socialising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the past week there wasn't really any proper socialising to speak of, like there was games night on Sunday, Savage Rifts is still on hiatus and we're playing Only War, it's been quite enjoyable so far, the last couple of sessions have been leading up to a mass battle so to speak, I feel like so far we've done relatively well, but I have no idea how many waves the GM is planning at throwing at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that it's been mostly a quiet week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work has been interesting, a lot of the current projects are getting into the proper swing of things now and managing them while working my tasks is a new experience for me, lately I feel like I've maybe been dedicating too much time to management type items rather than my major task on hand, but there's been a bunch of other jobs here and there eating up my time, all the jobs need to get done though so it's not a major issue currently. Ultimately I think I might need to take a little bit of time just to clear out and possibly deploy everything that I have in current development and reprioritise everything else so I have a clear action plan for the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal Development &amp;amp; Leisure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't actually do much of anything I was planning on doing that I mentioned in my last blog. No Perl, no Lisp, but a tiny bit of C++. I think that was mostly a motivation thing this week, I did however look certification/training from places like Amazon and Microsoft etc. I'm still not sure if I'm actually going to do any of it, but it's something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I didn't do as much PD as I was expecting to this week is I spent a good solid chunk of Saturday (when I usually do that kind of stuff) playing Axiom Verge, it's a game I've had for years, started up when I first bought it and then more or less never touched it again. It's a metroidvania, with not much of the "vania", I guess I'll write this for a general audience, "metroidvania" is a genre of video games which are a cross between the "Metroid" and "Castlevania" series. I've only ever played the first level of the first Castlevania game so I can't speak too much to that, and Super Metroid is the Metroid game I'm most familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a basic level, in Super Metroid you start the game off quite "weak" and with only a few options in what you can do, as you progress through the game you pick up power ups which either make you able to take on stronger and stronger enemies or unlock new places to go in the game world, one of the big draws for me personally with this style of game is the backtracking through places you've already been and finding new paths/items you missed on your first (or latter) time through. Also, the feeling that as you get better as a player your character gets stronger which isn't exactly intended, it's just a side affect of the natural progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to Axiom Verge however, it feels very much like a homage to Super Metroid (almost to the point of being a clone), with a few bits and pieces added which do make it feel fresh and interesting. If I were to have one complaint, it's that mobility around the world feels less, I guess, fluid than it does in Super Metroid, the most recent powerup I got before I stopped playing on Saturday was a grappling hook, which while a welcome addition, feels more clunky and harder to use than the one in Super Metroid, admittedly, the one in Super Metroid can only be used in very specific locations while this one in Axiom Verge appears to be usable pretty much anywhere there's a ceiling. The ability to wall jump if you have good timing is something I also miss in Axiom Verge, I was never particularly good at wall jumping, but it often helped if I messed up a jump I wouldn't fall all the way down to the beginning. Now don't get me wrong, it's still been a very enjoyable game, and so far I'd reccommend it, but above it I'd reccommend Super Metroid itself or Ori and the Blind Forest (another Metroidvania, with an absolutely gorgious art style)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This Blog &amp;amp; Hot Takes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't mention this in the personal development section because I felt it would fit better in this part here. I've started to redesign the theme of this blog, I've made minimal progress on it so far because it took me far longer than it should have to find where the default theme came from. (I quite like the default theme, so that's why I'm more going to make my own modifications to it, rather than start from scratch) I may of missed something but I got the default theme from the github repository for Pelican itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I could be an Australian, be involved in tech and not be staunchly against the &lt;a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6195"&gt;Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018&lt;/a&gt;. In short, it's basically the Australian Government implimenting a law which forces companies to assist law enforcement breaking users encryption on their data and messages. My major concerns with it are that the wording of the bill from what I understand doesn't actually mean that you need to be under investigation for anything, just tangentally involved in an investigation, I'll leave that to the reader to think of how far that could be stretched. If you are involved in an investigation, law enforcement can ask for access and the company could face financial penalties for refusing to assist. The second one which honestly worries me more is that the bill effectively allows the government to approach an individual developer and compel them to do effectively alter the software, and just letting their boss know what's going on is a crime which can result in jail time. I don't know how this works with rejected code reviews or anything along those lines, but it's definitely something to keep an eye on. All of this also seems to have very little oversight on top of that as well, because of course. Sorry to end on a bit of a down note, but it's something that I needed to mention&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so I'm going to try and actually write stuff for this blog, I don't know how many times I've said that, but now that it's got my actual name attached to it, maybe I'll actually do it this time. There's not a lot for me to talk about really, but lets go for it anyway, also I have this titled week ending, but that doesn't mean these will be weekly, probably more likely fortnightly or maybe monthly, or maybe when I actually have stuff to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Socialising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past couple of weeks has been pretty social actually, there was a thank you lunch for the CSSC a bit over a week or so ago, Christmas Lunch for work last week and there was "Crate Day" yesterday (at the time that I started writing this) which ended up more just being a pool party, but it was all pretty good honestly. I'm still to work out exactly when I'm going down south to see the Busselton guys, but currently it'll probably just around Christmas, timing will be a bit of a challenge seeing Ki and I are hosting Christmas this year for the immediate family and I've got from the 21st through to the 2nd of January. I guess I'll keep this blog updated with what actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not actually sure if/what exactly I can/should write about in this section because NDA and whatnot. I guess I'll just speak generally from my own point of view, which is a bit difficult when it's just going online. Lately I've been doing a lot of behind the scenes changes, reducing what technical debt we've aquired over the last little while, adding in checks to increase resilience, that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one of the things I always do is work on personal development, like I alluded to in my previous post, I tend to pick up many small projects in different languages, but only a small number of them actually reach completion. But on what I've been looking into lately - I haven't really had that much of a project that I'm working on besides helping a friend with coding a fan game project, maybe I'll talk about that some other time. In terms of actual PD, I've continued to teach myself how LISP sort of works, I've also looked a little bit into doing some perl and reminding myself how C kind of operates, maybe C++ when I touch C. I think for the time being I'll stick with mucking about with LISP in terms of new / infrequently used languages. And last but not least actually set up this server, and blog with pelican probably counts as personal development and finally getting back around to setting up github pages, which is pretty neat with pelican actually, you can check this blog's dev branch on github and you'll see that I've added to my make file an option to automatically publish to github. I'll probably add a make target to create a new file, maybe automatic with filling out the date and whatnot. I guess we'll see&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This Blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, I've decided I'll probably start doing stuff like this with the subtitles and stuff, it'll mean I can sort of get my ideas in at least a somewhat organised way. but like everything, this idea might get abandoned by the next time I write this.&lt;/p&gt;

Just like everyone else on the planet who has a blog, here's an awkward and exceedingly short first post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Anton Savill, at the time of writing this I am in my mid-twenties, married and work as a software engineer. This website will probably get promptly forgotten about like most of my other projects I've worked on over the years. One day I might make my 'side projects' folder public on github, but for now you'll just have to trust me when I say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular server is running on a Vultr instance, I have VentaCP installed to manage the actual server side of things and I've set up Pelican to act as my static site generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yeah, that's about it for now.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
