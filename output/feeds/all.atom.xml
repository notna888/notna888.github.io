&lt;p&gt;So I've been so busy the last few months I haven't really had time to write up a proper blog, but I've been on break for a week now, and I'm only just beginning to feel relaxed today pretty much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about writing up â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Media of the Decade&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've been so busy the last few months I haven't really had time to write up a proper blog, but I've been on break for a week now, and I'm only just beginning to feel relaxed today pretty much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about writing up like notable events for me over the past decade, but I'll probably end up posting a bunch to instagram, because that seems the relevant spot to put that kinda stuff.
Anyway, shout out to this tweet here ( https://twitter.com/domesticlullaby/status/1211608402310250496 ) for me actually writing this up, I was considering it, but this is encouragement etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't in any particular order, they're just one's that are notable to me that I saw in the last decade, I'll italicise all the one's that have been released in the past 10 years, just to differentiate them a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also leaving music off for now, because if I were to do that I would've had to start like a month ago just to go through my library and pull everything out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anime gets it's own category because it just makes it a little bit easier when separating them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to write a little something about each of these, won't be a long description though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akira&lt;br&gt;
It's a real shame it took me this long to see this film, I feel like it's the kind of thing that'll always be with me in some way or another, deep and ingrained. I'll probably go back and watch it again sometime soon because only a few disconnected plot elements remain in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;br&gt;
I finished this one only yesterday. I first attempted watching it all the way back in about 2010-2011. I'm not entirely sure why it took me so long as it was very enjoyable, I think it was I'd watch the first 5-10 episodes, then get busy with something else, and then come back later and start it again. Now that I persisted and actually got all the way through it, definitely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mob Psycho 100&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I'm terrible at binging shows, like, a binge for me is 2 or 3 episodes in a day, I mean, I assume that's terrible, basing that off my wife and general things online. I guess it's not even the 2-3 in a day, it's more that I do that once and then I don't watch anything for the next 2 or 3 days at all, there's been a small number of shows where I'm not beholden to this, the most recent of such shows is Mob Psycho 100, I'm not 100% of what it is about it that drew me in and held on, but I have no hesitation recommending it to anyone. Not to mention one of my new favourite music artists has a few AMV's. search up Lex the Lexicon Artist for her work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Food Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Food wars, food wars, food wars... There's not much to say besides it's a shounen where the main character cooks so good he blows people's clothes off. I watched it for the meme of it and it managed to sucker me in, worth a shot, but if the characters don't interest you in the first couple of episodes, I'd probably let it lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Punch Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you haven't heard of this one then, I'm not sure what to say. The show in premise is a parody of a bunch of other anime's where the main character is able to just win, regardless of the insurmountable odds, and this takes it to the extreme in that Saitama (main character) is able to defeat any opponent with a single punch. The premise alone is worth it in my opinion, but the nonchalance of Saitama is what really carries it in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex&lt;br&gt;
So, this is what I thought Ghost in the Shell was for the longest time, and then when playing Cyberpunk 2020 with some friends, and they described this as "Cyberpunk" along with some other items (which allude me currently) I was a bit confused, because while the movies (which I only watched last year or the year before or so) are very much cyberpunk with the grim view of the future and whatnot, SAC feels a lot more positive and happy, especially the Tachikomas. Which is worth watching the show on their own for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;br&gt;
Alright, so this one is one of those you either like or you don't. I'm not ashamed to admit that at the end of it, it kind of messed me up a little and I had to take a few hours just to absorb it all once it was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Angel Beats&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Out of all the one's I've listed here, if you haven't seen it, I'd recommend this one. It's super endearing and gets kind of emotional at the end. It's the one anime I know that my wife has sat down and watched more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steins;Gate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This one's probably my favourite of the decade, it makes reference to the old internet story of John Titor, it's sci-fi, it's got time travel stuff, and it has Tu-tu-ru girl. (it makes sense if you've seen it). I've really been meaning to go back and watch the other series that they've released. I believe they're sequels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Movies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, movies. I've watched a lot more movies than anime over the last decade, so this one will be a lot more terse, and I'll probably just skim over a majority of the ones I've seen. No particular order. These are also one's where I just recommend you go look up the synopsis yourself and decide from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mad Max: Fury Road&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shutter Island&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Imitation Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baby Driver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Her&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside Out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Theory of Everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Train Your Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solo: A Star Wars Story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tron: Legacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dating these movies I've watched for the first time, but not from the past decade&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cube (1997)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Net (1996)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunshine (2007)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hackers (1995)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;War Games (1983)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V for Vendetta (2005)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clerks (1994)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill &amp;amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is probably a great number I have missed, but these are all that come to mind that I would watch again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;T.V. Shows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these, I watched before 2010, but these are one's that either finished in the last decade, or I went back and watched through the entire series since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adventure Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gravity Falls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Gate: SG1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Gate: Atlantis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Gate: Universe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avatar: The Legend of Korra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daria&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parks and Recreation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrubs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sherlock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bobs Burgers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Who&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mr. Robot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Ken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firefly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ones below I haven't finished watching, for any number of reasons, but most I want to go back and get back into. Some of them I've only seen one or two episodes and I need to watch more to properly decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Flash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legends of Tomorrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;House&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invader Zim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Farscape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star vs. the Forces of Evil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Westworld&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terra Nova&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person of Interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So that's the list.. Maybe I'll keep this one updated, or maybe I'll post updates to it, who knows.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, have a lovely new years eve, and a lovely new decade.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>2019-10-07</title><link href="https://anton.savill.id.au%5C2019-10-07.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-07T20:30:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-10-07T20:30:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Anton Savill</name></author><id>tag:anton.savill.id.au\2019-10-07.html,2019-10-07:</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Blog Post 2019-10-07&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Last month recap.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another whole month and it's gone by so quickly, I didn't even actually realise until a few days ago that it wasn't August anymore. i.e. I completely missed September (and the first week of October it seems). If I'm completely honest I don't really think I've done &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much, I mean, I feel like I've been productive and gotten things done when they've needed to be done, it's just gone by without me noticing. Now I'm not sure if this is a side effect of me settling into a routine of just consistent output instead of my more burst/downtime type workflow I used to have or something else. It might be even though I've had some notable things the last month, the fact that I always keep myself busy means I haven't had a chance to properly reflect, which is what this blog is for at the end of the day I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also decided unless it's something worth writing about I don't think I will actually write about it. For example, this month it's been business as usual at work, so besides this brief mention here, I don't think I'll touch on it like I have in previous blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Royal Show&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went to the Perth Royal Show with my wife this weekend, it was quite nice just to spend some time with her, and I think honestly this will be mostly what I talk about here. I wasn't ever really one for the show. it was something I'd do occasionally as my friends would be going and when I was a child, but even then, it was always the local show, not the one here in the city. Maybe I'm jaded in my "old age" but I don't think the show is really something for me, I'll go there with my wife for her as she quite enjoys it, and when I eventually have children I see myself bringing them to the show too, but it's not really something for me, if that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, down in my hometown we had a show that would run for one evening and one day (Friday/Saturday) and besides I think once or twice, every year we didn't go to see the fireworks, it didn't really matter to my family growing up - for us a family outing was more something like going out fishing and stuff along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did sort of have more to talk about, but I kind of stalled on writing it (kind of don't know where the last 5 days have gone tbh), and now I'm just going to wrap it up with a very small little bit about something I do. It's about fireworks again. I always feel it's a little pretentious when I go to talk about this with someone or bringing it up. Basically I always try to watch the firework from when it launches, to an explosion, and when the explosion fans out, I follow just one of the "spokes" I guess, and with some of them, the spokes that come off them, down to the last little spec of light from that one, even if there's been another one (or more) that have launched since I started watching that one, it sort of gives me a little peace, I'm not sure if it's got some deeper meaning to me that I'm not fully sure on like "I can't see everything, so may as well focus on what I can" or maybe something deeper to do with life and how things burn out in time, but there'll be more after us or something like that... Either way, it makes me feel at ease, and while I'm writing this short little thing, which I was planning on going into detail on a lot more, I thought I'd just sort of, finish off with this. Maybe it is the focus on what you can thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anyway, that's me for now, I'll see if I can write more for the next post. Cheers&lt;/h3&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>2019-08-31</title><link href="https://anton.savill.id.au%5C2019-08-31.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-08-31T14:30:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-08-31T14:30:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Anton Savill</name></author><id>tag:anton.savill.id.au\2019-08-31.html,2019-08-31:</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Tool - Fear Inoculum&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I've been going on a bit about it lately, but I've finally finished listening to the new Tool album. I was going to go on a bit of a tweet storm about it, but I thought I should instead just post about it on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't going to be a long post, nor will it be fully coherent, I feel I just want to get this down in words, I might edit it in future if I ever come back to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, holy shit this is a hell of an album. I think my favourite song on the album is the second track, Pneuma, in particular the movement about half way through the song. Oh yeah, with a few exceptions each song is over 10 minutes long, but each one of these has different parts, kind of like how classical music has different movements and whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's without a doubt a Tool album. That bit isn't up for debate at all. I will say a lot of the tracks are a bit more mellow than what I was expecting, I know the title track is a pretty distant one, but I was sort of expecting that to be a bit like how the first track on Meddle by Pink Floyd is kind of spacey and distant, not that I'm disappointed or anything (not in the slightest). I'm now going back through some of my other favourite Tool songs and I can really hear how they've refined their sound. I think Lateralus will still be my favourite album, but I think I will need a couple of repeat listens, maybe with the lyrics up the next time through, I never really appreciated 10,000 days until I had done that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm glad I got the digital edition with the small little interludes between tracks, I read that the drummer had wanted to make the entire album a single long song (which is a thing I'm a massive sucker for) and these bridging songs definitely improved it for me, but it's already a bit of an ask in these days to put aside an hour and a half to just get the full experience, so 10-15 minute long tracks is probably the better way of doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;That's it for my ramblings today, I hope this makes some sense.&lt;/h3&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>2019-08-26</title><link href="https://anton.savill.id.au%5C2019-08-26.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-08-26T17:55:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-08-26T17:55:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Anton Savill</name></author><id>tag:anton.savill.id.au\2019-08-26.html,2019-08-26:</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Blog Post 2019-08-26&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we're about 65% of the way through 2019. And I'm still thinking that 2017 was last year. I feel like I'm missing so much time and I really don't know where it's gone. This is fine however, because time flies when you're having fun... right? Right â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Blog Post 2019-08-26&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we're about 65% of the way through 2019. And I'm still thinking that 2017 was last year. I feel like I'm missing so much time and I really don't know where it's gone. This is fine however, because time flies when you're having fun... right? Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work has, as always, been busy, it's been good however, I've recently taken up documenting and serving the documentation using pydoc, I have briefly looked at spinx, and I might still go to using it, but one of my biggest problems has been having documentation in two different places. Having it all in one place makes it a lot nicer and easier for me to maintain everything. The next thing I'm looking at properly trying to approach is type annotations. The main thing holding me back from that is how best to use the typing library with objects and whatnot, but that's something for future me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also the fact that I've slowly been moving away from just straight development/IT work and how I've been spending more time on other parts of the business. I won't go into details here, but I guess this helps cement my own personal opinion of me being a bit of a jack of all trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides that everything is more or less business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Socialising &amp;amp; Game night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't really spoken about socialising as a thing on it's own for quite a while because for the most part socialising has been the game night/game day/etc. I've been going to. I did the math somewhat recently, and in total I spend over 24 hours a week with friends playing these ttrpgs. I guess when I look at it that way, there's no surprise that I feel like I have significantly less time than I did a few months back. Oh well, it's been fun either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been a bunch of things that have happened since I last properly spoke about game nights, and I probably will write a full update, but I think currently it's best just to look at my twitter for some of my out of context quotes. Part of the reason I've been tweeting them is because they're legitimately funny, but also it feeds into my bot, and I'm really hoping for that to start pulling bits and pieces out of those tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ttrpgs aside, I've done some other socialising, a few weeks back I caught up with an ex of mine. That was nice seeing and catching up with her. It's been god knows how long it's been since we last saw each other. She was my first "real" girlfriend but we're still really good friends and I'm really quite thankful for that. There was also going out for lunch with a friend of mine for their birthday, and that was really nice too. I know I'm glossing over details here, but that's because I'd feel a bit weird just recounting everything I do while hanging with friends here, even if it is just me at the end of the day who reads this. I guess one thing worth saying is that in both cases I've gone places in Perth that I haven't actually been before, or I've been through the area, but not really spent any significant amount of time there. I guess it's a small thing, but having friends to spend time with really grounds me, it's quite nice and it's hard to explain more than that I think&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Side Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've for the most part been neglecting my side projects, this blog has been the one getting the most amount of attention and that's just writing content for it, but something I can probably say is that I've been sort of working on making my own ttrpg system to tell a particular story that I've been wanting to tell, problem I'm currently facing is I keep adding more and more things to it, making it overly complicated, so I'm probably going to have to cut down on that quite a bit to save my poor potential players. That being said I am writing some other bits and pieces to help with it. I might even push up some of these, maybe, we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual I can't stick with just reading and finishing what I'm currently reading, I have to pick up more things and attempt to read about 8 books at once, in the last month I've added "I have no mouth but I must scream" to my reading list along with "John dies at the end" but the latter I've basically only just started. Both seem good, and I've just remembered I was reading Jam by Yahtzee Croshaw at the start of the year, I really must go back to that...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my wife found this picture last month which is one of those 31 day song challenge things where you list off a different song each day and I was intending on posting it for my July post, but I forgot about it until literally 2 minutes ago so I thought I'd fire up my text editor and do it now, although as my music collection on my computer is literally weeks long I might take a while to actually post this... I have friends who's thing is like television shows or movies or books, I guess my thing is music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song you like with a color in the title:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA52uNzx7Y4"&gt;Blue (Da Ba Dee) - Eiffel 65&lt;/a&gt; and my wife put Paint It Black by the Rolling Stones, two types of people I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song with a number in the title:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJq9y9xPKWs"&gt;10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2) - Tool&lt;/a&gt; I sort of put this in originally as a throw away, but looking into the background of this song, now when I listen to it I get slightly tingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song that reminds you of summer time:&lt;/em&gt; I'm not entirely sure why I associate &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO2b3cggqs0"&gt;Zebra - John Butler Trio&lt;/a&gt; with summer, but it's just something that's always been with me, even if some of the other songs in this list are more "summer-y"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song that reminds you of someone you'd rather forget:&lt;/em&gt; This one's a bit of a hard one for me because I don't really have anyone I'd rather forget... I guess the closest I've got to this is: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiAuAJBZuGs"&gt;Crush - Tessa Violet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song that needs to be played loud:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fVE8kSM43I"&gt;Duality - Slipknot&lt;/a&gt; It's a Slipknot song that's not one of their ballads. It's probably a crime not to play it loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song that makes you want to dance:&lt;/em&gt; I don't really dance, but &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WOKk1i_eL8"&gt;Bae City Rollaz (wâ€‹/â€‹Ð˜Î”Î¤VÐ˜) - YUNG BAE&lt;/a&gt; always makes me bop along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song to drive to:&lt;/em&gt; Okay, so this one deserves it's own little story, back when one of my best mates first got on his P's he came and picked me up to go for a drive. Obviously being two mid to late teenagers we were playing heavy stuff, some rap, drum and bass, all that kind of high energy stuff, and the first thing I played when he ran out of suggestions of what he wanted me to play, I played &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dYNttdgl0"&gt;Spring - Vivaldi&lt;/a&gt; mostly as a joke and a change of pass but as we were going down these back roads of my hometown it just suited the mood so well, the triumphant tones, and while I didn't realise it at the time, the joys of youth I guess. To this day, whenever I go for a drive with him, we always reminisce on that time. I really must take some time off and organise to hang out with him some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song about drugs or alcohol:&lt;/em&gt; I'm like 90% sure that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trGX3ET3jTQ"&gt;Dr. Feelgood&lt;/a&gt; is actually about drugs. (Edit: after watching the video for this song, it's 100% about drugs, no doubt about it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song that makes you happy:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8dsvclf3Tk"&gt;Mr. Blue Sky - Electric Light Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; It really couldn't of been anything else, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song that makes you sad:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GkVhgIeGJQ"&gt;Boys don't cry - The Cure&lt;/a&gt; - This one took me forever to work out because generally songs don't make me feel sad in of themselves, but the cure always holds this strange place for me. When I think of them I always come to the fact that they have their really love-y type songs, and then they have their darker side, both of which I adore for the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song that you never tire of:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypkv0HeUvTc"&gt;The Beautiful People - Marilyn Manson&lt;/a&gt; I'm not entirely sure why this one in particular, it might be how percussive it is, that being said I'm a sucker for Drop D tuning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song from your preteen years:&lt;/em&gt; It's not exactly from my preteen years, I mean it is from my early teen years when I heard it, but I'd probably have to go &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPIsh721z5c"&gt;Even - Simon Day&lt;/a&gt;. It's from the move "The Black Balloon", which is up there as one of my favourite films, favourite probably isn't the right word, but it's certainly one of the movies I consider the most important to me at the very least. Either that or if we're strictly going preteen, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtQHIv2O8x0"&gt;Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head - Gorillaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 13&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song you like from the 70's:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFrGuyw1V8s"&gt;Dancing Queen - ABBA&lt;/a&gt; but there's so many others I could've picked it's not even a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song you'd love to be played at your wedding:&lt;/em&gt; I mean, I think really the only song I actually cared about being played at some point during my wedding was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TX_W_CMwT8"&gt;Daybreak - Michael Haggins&lt;/a&gt; , which we did as my wife and I were signing the papers to make the marriage official and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song you like that's a cover by another artist:&lt;/em&gt; This one was giving me so much trouble because I couldn't think of a cover that I know that I prefer the cover to the original, I still for the most part like covers most bands do, just preference and whatnot. Then I remembered that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXlULkwhgrc"&gt;Jolene - The White Stripes&lt;/a&gt; exists. I sort of prefer the studio version, but I think this live version distils exactly what it is about this one that I prefer over the Dolly Parton one. This one feels more like they've already lost and their pleading for things to be different, where the original, while still very much pleading, still has a level of hope at things being able to be salvaged, if that makes sense. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song that's a classic favourite:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq-gYOrU8bA"&gt;You can call me Al - Paul Simon&lt;/a&gt; - Lets be real, most of the songs in this list could probably be considered classic favourites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song you'd sing a duet with someone on karaoke:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsUGxcvn8yw"&gt;My Eyes - Neil Patrick Harris and Felicia Day&lt;/a&gt; - From Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song from the year you were born:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25QyCxVkXwQ"&gt;Can you feel the love tonight - Elton John&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song that makes you think about life:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pgum6OT_VH8"&gt;Starlight - Muse&lt;/a&gt; It'd be remiss of me not to include at least one Muse song somewhere in this list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song that has many meanings to you:&lt;/em&gt; Right, so I couldn't really think of what to put here, but I ended up with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBsIHIIdQFA"&gt;Analogue Bubblebath - AFX&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn't so much have many meanings to me, but when I listen to it, it always makes me feel a whole wash of emotions, I'm not even too sure how to explain it besides the first time I listened to it, it brought me to tears and I kind of just had to sit there for another half hour after this little 4 minute and change song had finished. Richard James has so many aliases I'm not even completely sure AFX is the right one for this song, but I'm pretty sure he was going by that when he released this album, so that's what I've put it as.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song you like with a person's name in the title:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObzgUfCl28"&gt;Ruby - Kaiser Chiefs&lt;/a&gt; I completely forgot about this song until I went looking through my collection for names. I also forgot how great a song this one is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song that moves you forwards:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OO9LloDSJo"&gt;Things can only get better - Howard Jones&lt;/a&gt; Besides the title being endlessly optimistic, the lyrics in of themselves can always have a positive impact I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 23&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song you think everyone should listen to:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IsSpAOD6K8"&gt;Once in a lifetime - Talking Heads&lt;/a&gt; Which is probably one of my favourite songs I've stumbled back upon in the last few years. If nothing else the dance moves in the video clip for this song are worth it on it's own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 24&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song by a band you wish were still together:&lt;/em&gt; This one was a hard one for me because most of the bands that come to mind have actually come back together, like to list some that I had to double check, Rage Against the Machine, LCD Soundsystem, Pendulum, plus some that would probably be finished if they hadn't broken up when they had like The Clash and whatnot. So I sort of have to fall back to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6EQAOmJrbw"&gt;Teenagers - The Black Parade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 25&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song you like by an artist no longer living:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRCgKWOdu-g"&gt;Billy the Mountain - Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention&lt;/a&gt; The longest "song" on this list coming in at a whopping 28+ minutes. It's more a story than a song at this point, but I'm the one writing this and I make the rules here. At the start he mentions when they played it previously, and that fanatics will know exactly where they've changed things. I know exactly where they changed things. I'm a bit torn on whether I prefer this one of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 26&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song that makes you want to fall in love:&lt;/em&gt; Probably has to go to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVpv8-5XWOI"&gt;Hey, Soul Sister - Train&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 27&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song that breaks your heart:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZdEeBdkYh4"&gt;Valence - Habadashary&lt;/a&gt; - I feel kinda bad linking this one because it was on 99 views and it was uploaded 9 years ago. That being said, as I said in my last blog post, the reason this one is so special to me is for me and one other person, so only 99 views makes sense in a way...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 28&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song by an artist whose voice you love:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec6p9GwASC0"&gt;Satellite Mind - Metric&lt;/a&gt; - I've picked the acoustic version here, but honestly I could've put a metric song for a bunch of these days. I really do feel like this band is a bit of a hidden gem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 29&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song you remember from your childhood:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk7N3dhzM1o"&gt;Hello - The Cat Empire&lt;/a&gt; I distinctly remember for about a week or two straight I heard this song multiple times a day, just out and about in different situations, I think it was also on a T.V. ad, which didn't help, but there's a special spot for this song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 30&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song that reminds you of yourself:&lt;/em&gt; Took me a while to work out this one specifically because there's so many other songs on this list that remind me of me, It's one of the reasons I listen to these songs... I finally settled on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lyu1KKwC74"&gt;Bitter Sweet Symphony - The Verve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 31&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A song that comforts your soul:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3J_2R9rAp8"&gt;Fearless - Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt; Ever since I first head this song back when I was probably about 9 years old it has been my favourite song of all time. I might one day go into much more detail on why this song in particular, but looking at the categories probably over half of these could've just been this. If I have one request it's to have this song played at my funeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And that's it.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this took me much longer than I was expecting to write, but it's done now, and I can push this up. I'll probably throw together a normal blog post some time in the next week, but until then, I'll catchya around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s. tweet at me on twitter if you do this list. I kind really quite like these kind of things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>2019-07</title><link href="https://anton.savill.id.au%5C2019-07.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-24T23:30:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-07-24T23:30:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Anton Savill</name></author><id>tag:anton.savill.id.au\2019-07.html,2019-07-24:</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Blog for July 2019&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I haven't really much to discuss this month, it's kind of just flown by in what feels like an instant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I do want to talk about though is the notion of a 10x engineer that I somehow only found out about this month â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Blog for July 2019&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I haven't really much to discuss this month, it's kind of just flown by in what feels like an instant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I do want to talk about though is the notion of a 10x engineer that I somehow only found out about this month. Now, while I agree with the idea that in teams there are stronger and weaker engineers, I don't believe any individual could ever be worth 10 others. I'm not sure if the 10x is supposed to be taken literally or if it's just some nebulous idea that they're effectively worth 10 people because if you were to try and replace them you'd need about 10 people. If the latter I would be very hesitant in saying so, but I probably would say I am one of these fabled 10x engineers. It's not good to think this way however obviously, but when I think to my skill set and how varied it is, along with my deep understanding of how much of the software at my work operates (in no small part that I've at the very least needed to debug or slightly rewrite parts, if it's not something of my own creation), it is somewhat difficult not to think highly of myself in this very specific sense. This being said, I kind of wish I wasn't. Now I don't think I could be one of those "brilliant jerks" or have the mindset of not wanting to teach my colleagues stuff because it'd be faster for me to do it myself, quite the contrary, I like to think I'm pretty well liked in the office and any time I'm able to offer advice or help with programming something, I jump at the opportunity, in fact, I subscribe to the thinking that as a sort of pseudo-manager / project lead that I am, my ultimate goal is to make myself redundant, so the team is able to keep going without me around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess another thing is that I've been posting a lot more on twitter lately, I think that's mostly I just haven't been motivated to sit down and write out a long blog post like this, I'm still not entirely focused on this if I'm honest, the only reason I am is because I said to myself this morning that I would, and I'm not one to back out of things I say I'm going to do, doesn't mean this is going to be a long post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that is good while I write this is that I have at long last found an old treasured song of mine, more or less after I had given up on finding it, Valence from the band Haberdashery. I won't go into much detail on this song I don't think, but the short of it is after my second girlfriend and I broke up, this song more or less acted as a good capstone for the relationship and our friendship going forwards, well I thought it did at least. There are a couple of very specific wordings within the lyrics which really only make sense as to why it's significant to probably herself and I. Some things should remain unsaid, and going into this any more is probably bordering on that, not that it's anything controversial or anything I'm embarrassed about, it's more that's something that was ours, and I think I'm going to keep it that way, which is something I've been meaning to work on more, having stuff that's just between me and another person, in jokes with an audience of two. Not that I'm incapable of it, just that it's something I enjoy having with people, so I should aim to do it more I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else I suppose worth mentioning, a few days ago I renewed this domain, so I guess I'll be writing these blogs for at least another year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I know this is a short one, but thanks for reading, and I'll catchya next time&lt;/h3&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>2019-06</title><link href="https://anton.savill.id.au%5C2019-06.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-06-22T18:30:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-06-22T18:30:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Anton Savill</name></author><id>tag:anton.savill.id.au\2019-06.html,2019-06-22:</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Blog for June 2019&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another month, another day that I set aside to type up some of my thoughts and whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I wrote my last post, I did try to write another one on the fact that I turned 25 and what that actually meant for me. Each â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Blog for June 2019&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another month, another day that I set aside to type up some of my thoughts and whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I wrote my last post, I did try to write another one on the fact that I turned 25 and what that actually meant for me. Each time I went to though I couldn't really come up with anything. I'm not sure if that's the headspace I was in at the time (woo for a quarter life crisis) or if it was just I didn't actually have anything of worth to say, some might say I still don't, but we'll ignore that niggling feeling at the back of my head for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have the problem where I don't give myself time, I move from one thing to the next, even when I should be idle, or focused on what's happening in front of me, I have other things going on in the back of my head. I am getting slightly better though, Wednesday night I took about a half hour just to stand out in the back yard and let myself centre again. I don't believe I've done that since I lived down south. I guess it's kind of a form of meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not particularly a spiritual person, nor do I really believe in positive or negative energies, or anything along those lines, but what I do believe in is the power of thought, and inhaling "clean" air and exhaling negativity and stress does make me feel better and at ease, at least for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I do when I write up these is that I look back to my most recent entry, I usually just start a fresh and not bother really going into much that I talked about before, but I feel like I should address something, in my fourth paragraph I avoid being idle not because it's unpleasant, just that it's unproductive - that's an outright lie I tell myself, I outright don't like it, I have my doubts on how much thinking about it would help, but I'm sure there's probably some value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I remember correctly I mentioned in some earlier blog that I wanted to keep this thing mostly light in this whole endeavour, but I'm not rethinking that somewhat, I mean, I'm not going to go into super deep and personal stuff here, I'm not about that hanging dirty laundry in the open air, the url is literally my name after all, but I think I'm going to try and be a little more open here, I mean it is supposed to be a kinda diary and I'm not important enough for this to really matter I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess we'll see how much I stick to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work has been the same as always, more jobs to get done than I have time in a day. In the spirit of being more open here, I've half been grappling with a form of impostor syndrome. The product recently crossed over some 20 thousand lines (I think - either that or 15 thousand) I've still got a good 8 or 9 months on my current contract, and I am leaning towards renewing when that runs out, but either way I've started to make a concerted effort for everything to be commented and be much more maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been spending some of what spare time I have reading. I might put together a list of one's at some point that covers all the design principles and project management etc that is something I personally struggle with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books &amp;amp; Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I'm one who strongly believes in reading for entertainment, I'm not sure if I've mentioned this before on this blog, but it's true. My main problem is I start reading about 4 books at the same time and as I work through them I pick up others, to give you an idea I've been reading the first book of the lord of the rings series since about January, sneaking a couple of pages during my spare time when I can, but being much more into the "joy of computing" than I am hobbits (don't get me wrong, hobbits are my jam, just computing in the abstract draws me more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first I'm going to mention is: Lauren Ipsum: A Story About Computer Science and Other Improbable Things.
It's pretty clearly written for a parent to read to their child to introduce them to the fundamental ideas that programming deals with. It's been incredibly charming and enjoyable to read, and when I do have children it's definitely one I'm going to read to them... the hard bit for me is when to read it to them. For example It introduces the idea of a heuristic through a character "Hugh Rustic" who presents the idea that you don't need the perfect solution, all you really need is a good enough one where a perfect one will take far too long to work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second I've been reading is: Algorithms to Live By.
This one is much more those who are older, but it again, doesn't even touch on code, and is much more focused on how algorithms are just a list of instructions which result in an answer, I'm not usually one to recommend youtube videos but &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVRGadNoHC0"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; more or less summarises the first chapter. If the video peaks an interest, I strongly recommend reading the book, there are a lot of the same beats she touches on, but in the book they go much more into the juicy details, but not in a boring way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last is one I'm yet to actually start reading in earnest because I only discovered it today: Blown to Bits.
From what I've seen of it so far it appears to more concerned with the effects of the digital explosion, maybe a bit like the hacker crackdown (another excellent computer related book) as this one isn't so much about computers, or even algorithms, but more like society. Again, I'm yet to read it so I can't comment properly on it so far, but the reviews I've read seem very positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Socialising and Game Night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm in an interesting spot with game night currently. The two most developed characters have had their character arcs, and now I need to come up with more for them, I guess for this one I'll just talk about my Only War character I play on Sunday during the day.
~~Radar~~ Sonar (longish story) from the characters inception as an npc was obsessed with Jetbikes, when my character came to an untimely end, I was offered the chance to pick them back up and play them, which I did, embracing this character quick much to the parties chagrin on many different occasions. 2 sessions ago now, they finally got one (I try to use gender neutral naming for them as they kind of switch between being a female and male, there's no real character based reason behind that, it's purely a bit of flavour, they're more often a male though just because it's easier seeing that I'm a male myself). Anyway, in the 40k universe Jetbikes (basically motorbikes that use jets instead of wheels) are incredibly rare, unless you go to the chaos side of things and get one from the Dark Eldar (which Sonar has done by proxy) So this is quite heretical and they're going to be running the risk of just outright being killed for being involved in the ruinous powers. If they live long enough though I think they're  going to go down the path of where they just slowly become despondent. I mean, when your entire life has been about getting a jetbike, and you get one, what do you next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I've been writing this for a a couple of hours now, I had dinner during it but either way, I think that'll about wrap it up for this post, I might try and write more often, but no promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;That's all for this month I think, thanks for reading, cya soon :)&lt;/h3&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Why I choose to do things the hard way</title><link href="https://anton.savill.id.au%5Cwhy-i-choose-to-do-things-the-hard-way.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-04T20:30:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-05-04T20:30:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Anton Savill</name></author><id>tag:anton.savill.id.au\why-i-choose-to-do-things-the-hard-way.html,2019-05-04:</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, this blog post is a bit out of my normal schedule that I've settled into lately, but that doesn't really matter because what is a schedule for a personal project anyway?

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the reason for this â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, this blog post is a bit out of my normal schedule that I've settled into lately, but that doesn't really matter because what is a schedule for a personal project anyway? There's no deadlines here, no expectations, and that's why this is a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the reason for this post is that it's only just dawned on me over the past few days that I'm fast approaching my 25th birthday, I normally make jokes about my age along the lines of denying it, insisting that I'm still a teenager and going on about how you're only as old as you feel, but not in this case. To be clear, I know I'm still young, that people older than me have all crossed this checkpoint in life and that I (hopefully) still have quite a bit time left on this planet. It's just the idea of actually being alive for a quarter of a century that's kind of thrown me.
(I promise after this self indulgent introspection I'll get to the point of this post)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the thing that's most getting me with this is that I never really bothered with the previous "milestones" so to speak, like sure, I celebrated my 18th and my 21st, but thinking back on that they were both just regular days to me. That also being said, while at uni my birthday was always during the last couple of weeks of semester 1 when a lot of assignments would be coming in, so I'd always put any celebration off until after exams, and then when it got to that point I felt like it had been too long since then to actually celebrate my birthday, and there's nothing in particular special about a birthday anyway, so why bother?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one just feels different though, like 25 should mean something, that I'm wiser, more experience, moving onto a new stage, or I should be at least, but like everyone, I have no idea what I'm doing, I plod along from day to day, occasionally expressing these ideas, but for the most part filling my time with as much stuff as I possibly can so I don't sit idle and think about this kinda stuff, not because it's unpleasant, but because I feel it's unproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say though, I will probably be celebrating my birthday this year, a lot of my university friends have graduated now, so that's less of an issue, and those who still are, thanks to how uwa has changed from a 13 weeks to a 12 week semester, my birthday now falls right on the study break, I guess it's fitting that the milestone I actually care about for some reason is one I feel comfortable celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;That's all well and good, but what does this have to do with doing things the hard way?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hear you asking, or maybe not, you did just read this though so I guess I forced you to think it? The temptation to go on a tangent about pink monkeys is pretty strong, but lets move on shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I should probably specify some parts of this statement. This pretty much only applies to where I can do things the hard way in my own leisure time. When at work, or doing something which others may want to use, I'll do my best to use libraries or ways that have been designed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should probably also list off my current side projects:
Currently, my main two projects are, Seagull, which is a sort of static site generator which can be found on my github, and an, as yet, unnamed budgeting program. Of course I've got a bunch of other one's, the beginnings of a msn clone type thing, specifically msn plus, which was something some friends and I spent ages playing around with back in the day, a webpage that kinda piggy backs off youtube, but fixes some of the stuff I'm not a fan of with the homepage/subscription feed and about 9 different starts of projects from where I decided I wanted to pick up a language, but never really stuck it through. There's more than likely more things, but that's currently it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started writing this I had an idea of how I was to come to this big conclusion of how doing things the hard way means when you do it an easy way later on, but the easy way doesn't work exactly right, you can fall back on the hard way, but that doesn't quite seem right now that I think of it more. I mean, this blog is powered by Pelican, a /real/ static site generator, with markdown and everything, I've barely touched the theme, in fact, the changes I had made I don't think I've committed yet, so that's still coming itself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all about what you chose to do, the flexibility which comes with doing stuff from scratch, the sticking with the default, or somewhere in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I need to spend some more time soul searching, and then I'll issue an update to this post, I guess we'll see in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Until next time, cya around.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said last month was a bit of a whirlwind, well this one's been a hurricane. I've been taking time where I can but everything has been moving forwards at an astounding pace, today's the 24th and I haven't been at the office since the 20th and I'm only properly feeling relaxed today, I made a promise to myself to check my emails while I'm down south, but not to reply to any of them until at least Friday unless stuff is particularly dire (I made a few fixes on Sunday remoting in and whatnot) Something good though is I haven't seen a single email saying that there's been an error on the platform for a good 2 weeks now, It's not a common problem getting an error message or anything, it's just nice not needing to have to fix things I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned today's the first day I'm feeling sort of relaxed, I think that's because I've properly switched off for a bit. Last time I had a break I spent the whole thing developing a side project for work, and before then it was my honeymoon. So, that's something I guess&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Socialising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socialising has been relatively limited for me, but more than it has been. Catching up with friends for lunch around work etc. I'm still to organise a house warming even though I've been in the current place for... over 3 months now, I'll probably get on that tomorrow afternoon.
I caught up with a friend on the weekend though. Took them to IKEA for the first time in their life, quite a good day out, I should probably remind myself of this and try to do stuff like that more often, maybe even get back to holding dinner parties with Ki, invite some of my friends who I haven't seen in years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game night has been trundling along, I was finally able to reveal to everyone in the party one of the twists the GM had set up with me, that my character in this campaign is the same as the one in the previous one, or a different version of the same one at least, now I've got to spend some time developing the two split personalities of this character to be different from one another, I've got some ideas, but I think I'll need to write up their full backstory and work off of that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been nice writing this blog, and I intend on continuing it, I'm still a bit conflicted on if I really want to push it for people to read or if I should just keep it as it is, more or less just me talking to myself... maybe if I ever get around to updating this theme, I'll push it more, who knows...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the last month has been a bit of a whirlwind. Some days were flat out, others were more relaxed but on those one's nothing seemed to work out right. Multiple projects have been coallessing together quite nicely which has been a massive weight off my shoulders. So that's positive I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Socialising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of work and games night (next section) I really only had one day of socialising. Which was O'Day, In previous years for the CSSC I feel like I was a major driving force behind sign ups, this year I sort of took a back seat to that which was nice, I still helped, don't get me wrong, but I was able to wander off for a little bit during the day, which was a bit different. Most years I hadn't bothered going to O'day seeing I only really got involved in the club close to the end of my degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should probably start refering to this section as something else because I've started attending another campaign during the day on Sundays. It's nice to have multiple groups with different dynamics, and the more I think about it the more I want to properly run my own session and try and bring in some people who haven't played before but putting more time into preparing sessions and all of that sort of stuff feels like it'd be a bit of a time sink that I already don't have time for. Maybe I'll look at running some modules or something for a couple of people one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;That's all for this month I think, thanks for reading, cya soon :)&lt;/h3&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>It's been a while</title><link href="https://anton.savill.id.au%5Cits-been-a-while.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-05T10:45:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-02-05T10:45:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Anton Savill</name></author><id>tag:anton.savill.id.au\its-been-a-while.html,2019-02-05:</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So it's been about 2 months since my last post.

&lt;h2&gt;I moved!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of the reason I haven't been posting is because I've been in the process of moving. I will miss the old place, I posted a semi-long status on facebook talking about it, I wont really repeat it here, I'll just say after living there for near on 5 years I grew really used to the place, I'm really beginning to settle into the new place, I can find myself around with the lights off and that's how I know I've basically got it down pat :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work's been quite good. Quite stressful with a lot of the ongoing projects, (not to mention one of the biggest database updates), but good none the less. Having my two interns helping me with it has been a god send, I'm not sure if I've mentioned this in a previous blog at all, but I feel like I'm sort of positioned to be a project leader. Maybe improving my organisation skills a bit and getting better at estimating time frames for completion and I'd happily take that role I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always I haven't done as much PD as I would like to, but I have spent a bit of time learning lisp, but then I got side tracked with some of the binary mathematics you can do. Aside: I think there's a way to do subscript in markdown, but I need to catch a bus in a bit so the letters b and d after the number just say whether it's binary or decimal. It's pretty obvious when you think about it, but you can take a number like 1101b (13d) and shift all the characters to the left and then put a zero in where there's a space so 11010b works out to be 26 in decimal. That works because in the binary system there's only two different values, the same thing happens if you do it with a decimal number like 15d, if you add a 0 on the right hand side it becomes 10 times as big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I discovered 2's compliment, but I really need to catch that bus now... Maybe next time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shows &amp;amp; Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I'll post this that often, but currently I'm watching my way through House and Andromeda in the evenings when I just need some time to clear my head. I was watching Star Trek: The Next Generation, but I kind of left it and it'd take me quite a while to get back into it so I've decided to go for another one of Gene Roddenberry's creations, I might go back to either TNG or maybe give Discovery another shot, I watched the first half of season 1 but after that I didn't really have a huge desire to go back when it came back, I guess we'll see
I've also finally gotten around to listening to the new Muse album, I really dig the additional tracks they did at the end with the Acoustic versions or "Alternate Reality" versions, I guess I strongly recommend it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday was the "season finale" in our current campaign of Only War, pretty sure I've talked about it in a previous blog so I won't go into it a bunch here, but I'm pretty satisfied with how it's gone. I've got to make my character for one of the campaigns we've got coming up in Savage Rifts and then there's the second Cyberpunk arc, which I'm incredibly keen for. I mean, I always enjoy our game nights and I'm kind of kicking myself that it took me until about this time last year to actually get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other things going on.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yesterday Ki and I were rear ended. No one was harmed and it was at a pretty slow speed as it was right near some traffic lights. Basically the taxi infront of us was stop-starting, Ki was doing the same but unfortunately the bloke behind us missed out on the stopping part. The three of us all agree it was the taxi drivers fault but unfortunately for the guy who hit us the insurance doesn't see it that way. Also unfortunately it's looking like the car is going to be a write off. Knocking on wood that it's not, and maybe looking into seeing if it could be a repairable writeoff and cancel the claim, because besides cosmetic damage to the bumper there's a bit of damage to where the boot latch connects (and that's where I think the write off is potentially coming from). I don't even think it's the fact that we'd be spending more money on a car than what we'd get back from insurance, I think it's the sheer waste of a perfectly good car with fresh tires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been dealing with a debt collector the last couple of weeks, A centerlink debt from 2012 with me apparently working at the Corner Store down south while I was living in Northam (overpayment because they only had my Tax Certificate and their records to go off). I'm actually typing this out while one of the operators looks into my case, going off her estimate it shouldn't be more than another 10 or 15 minutes. Initially I thought the company was a scam to be quite frank, first I received a text message asking me to call a phone number (which isn't the one on the debt collectors website), then a phone call using extremely obvious text to speech, it was only when I got a letter from them that I thought it could maybe be legit, but at that point I had already started discussing it with centerlink as I found out about the letters when changing my address on mygov. It seems their notification emails had been going to my spam. I've got my fingers crossed that this will all work out in my favour. Maybe I'll write an update on this blog when I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thanks for reading, I'll catchya next time :)&lt;/h3&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>A year in review</title><link href="https://anton.savill.id.au%5Ca-year-in-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-27T10:45:00+08:00</published><updated>2018-12-27T10:45:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Anton Savill</name></author><id>tag:anton.savill.id.au\a-year-in-review.html,2018-12-27:</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, for the last couple of years I've been writing sort of years in reviews on facebook, but with me more or less deciding not to post on facebook anymore I'm posting this here on my blog, but I'll probably link it there though, so Hi if you've come from â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, for the last couple of years I've been writing sort of years in reviews on facebook, but with me more or less deciding not to post on facebook anymore I'm posting this here on my blog, but I'll probably link it there though, so Hi if you've come from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I'll first off say why I'm posting here instead of facebook, I think I sort of touched on previously in another blog, but I guess I'll sum it up here. In short, I used to often post on facebook, long winded statuses talking about all manner of things. Eventually I just stopped writing them for a while and when I went back to writing them, I just didn't really find any reason to keep writing them I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this pretty much exactly a year from when I started working at my new job (I'm not publishing it until new years eve, but that's besides the point). It's been an incredible year there, I've learnt so much about sustainability that it's kind of hard for me to quantify it all. All I really know is that I thought I knew a decent amount at the start of the year, but I was quite mistaken with that. Same with programming, although it took a while to properly get up to speed with our codebase, but once I got to that point I've been able to expand it quite a bit, to the point where errors that have been there for who knows how long, rear their heads, I've introduced bugs myself, but it's been quite the experience on the software side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also left subway after 3 and a half years there. I'll have so many fond memories of that store, customers and creations I had made while there. Sometimes I still don't fully accept that I've hung up my sandwich artist hat, while half asleep the other day I actually went to log in to the sort of staff portal that Subway has to check if there was any training modules I hadn't done or if there was any news I hadn't read (about 4 months after I had left), and I've now been removed from the system. Looking at it now, it's obvious I was removed, but to half asleep Anton that was one of the most confusing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'd be remiss of me not to mention the people at both work places. At subway I've seen so many people come and go during my time there, every single one of them a unique individual, and I know because it's in a work environment it's kind of a bit strange to say this, but I consider pretty much anyone I worked with for any decent amount of time a friend, hell, when I left I wrote a letter to everyone, I wanted to write more for the newer people, but I just didn't have anything really to say, but the number of people I was writing letters too, I'd feel too terrible if I didn't write anything. That reminds me, I need to reply to a couple of messages from old work mates. I'll do that after I publish this I think, maybe in the new year, I guess I'll see about it. Then there's the people from my current work. I don't even know where to start in regards to that. I guess I was always apprehensive about getting a "proper" job as I kind of got used to talking with customers in my time with retail and hospitality, but my current work mates (who I also consider friends removed from work by the way) subdued those concerns rather quickly, also people who work in the shops around my work who recognise me make it easy too (even though it's a bit weird being on the other side of the counter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing I guess I should mention is that the place of my first job closed down this year (I think it was this year at least). It doesn't really surprise me with all the development happening around that area, also from what I was told the people who took over made some bad decisions with how they ran that store, I'm not going to be too critical as I don't know what's really involved in running a small business, but I knew that store seeing I worked there for a good 4 or so years. Maybe when I've made my millions I'll go back and buy a small corner shop like that one and see how I go, then maybe I'll have more to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's mostly work without going into too much detail I think. Then There's the Computer Science Students Club at UWA. I was president last year and my wife took over this year. She's a psych major so we're nothing but inclusive. I've kept in contact with a bunch of people who I met through the club and it truly made my last little while at UWA so enjoyable. I've only been marginally involved in the club this year through my wife, but I have liked the fact that I've been able to be involved in it past my graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year was also the year I started to be involved in Role Playing games, (Like dungeons and dragons, etc). I've wanted to play for years and years but I never really found a group until a friend who I met through the CSSC invited my wife and I to join a game. It was set in the Warhammer 40k Universe using the Dark Heresy 2 rules. In this grimdark universe set some 38 thousand years into the future where demons can randomly burst through into this reality, mess with you until you grow wings and are catatonic from the sheer insanity inflicted upon you, I made myself a botanist. I will probably one day write up a full thing about Petrubius (my characters name) but I've always enjoyed playing, I guess, weird characters. For example my botanist had a gravity hammer and would on fly into a blind rage if needed, probably my most memorable moments with him was when going up against enemy combatants who were in a building, in short the building ended up collapsing, one of the enemies telekinetically flung a bit rubble away which just happened to hit my character and while in this rage, he now considered the collapsed building to be the enemy. On my rolls to break out of the rage, I was failing quite badly, but to hit the building I was rolling exceedingly well, only occasionally hurting the actual enemies.
After that campaign we switched systems to cyberpunk. In that system I played a man who may as well be the Phantom of the Opera, and overly patriotic English politician and then a "retired" war criminal with a mech suit which stands over 12 feet tall with a certain partiality to nerve gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year has certainly been something for me, and I'm looking forward to next year and all the things that'll come&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I think that's about it for this year, I wish you all the best in the new year, cheers!&lt;/h3&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>And a happy new year</title><link href="https://anton.savill.id.au%5Cand-a-happy-new-year.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-26T21:50:00+08:00</published><updated>2018-12-26T21:50:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Anton Savill</name></author><id>tag:anton.savill.id.au\and-a-happy-new-year.html,2018-12-26:</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Anton's log, date 20181226&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I took a bit of a break from these posts, that's mostly because not a lot extra has been happening, and it's the whole "if you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all" and I guess I've applied good to also apply â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Anton's log, date 20181226&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I took a bit of a break from these posts, that's mostly because not a lot extra has been happening, and it's the whole "if you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all" and I guess I've applied good to also apply to interesting/insightful, I don't have much to add for this post, but I feel I should at least put something out there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Socialising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's again, been a relatively quiet couple of weeks for me by the normal definition of socialising. I did however have a friend of mine from high school move in with my wife and I. The three of us will be moving into a house sometime in the new year, not too far from where we currently are which is pretty convenient, it'll be a longer walk to the bus/train station and the nearest shops, but that being said it'd be pretty hard to match where we currently are in that regard, it's probably honestly one of the best places to live as a broke uni student without a car location wise, there's not even that many options on uber eats around our place, but yeah, that should be pretty good I think, We'll all go from being pretty cramped to having more space than what we know what to do with (Maybe, probably not, but well see)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also took my two interns out for a kind of Christmas/Thank you lunch thing. The entire office had a Christmas in late November, but this was specifically for them as I felt that it would be a good way to show my appreciation to them. I guess it's also a part of my personal creed sort of thing that anyone who could be considered an "underling" (Sorry to either of my interns if you happen to read this) I need to take personal responsibility for. I've been working on giving them more autonomy and for them more to come to me when they have a problem, but I think I find it more interesting to see how they approach problems and to be immediately available if I'm needed, not that I don't like coding something myself or have an aversion or anything along those lines, I just like being somewhat of an in-house consultant I guess. Knowing how or at least having an understanding of how all the different bits mesh together, the limitations and future scope etc. but also being able to jump in and do some coding myself where it's needed I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also been a couple of game nights too, I might go into detail of them one of these days, not this one though. I have finally managed to develop my current character a bit though, which is always good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and while I'm writing this I'm in the car next to my wife on the way down south, to catch up with that group of mates and family and whatnot. I'll be back up in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much else to say on work, just been finalising some ongoing projects that have been in development for a while and making sure the platform was rock solid before going on break over Christmas, the longest continuous break that I would've had in about 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal Development &amp;amp; Leisure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've finally done a bit of mucking about with lisp again, a touch of hylang, nothing substantial still. I've started rewriting the CSSC sign up page to use Django in place of PHP. I might do some stuff with Flask in the next week or two, I guess it's the thing of too much to do, not enough time to do it all. I've packed up my computer since my friend moved in with us, so I haven't gone back to Axiom Verge, I have been playing a bit of Super Smash Brothers with her though as she has a switch and all that. PD is still what I mostly do in my spare time though&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This Blog &amp;amp; Hot Takes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still to properly make the changes to the theme for this blog, but that's okay, I'll get there eventually. I am thinking of more or less writing a full year review for 2018 and posting that to this blog, but that probably wont happen until early next year too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not really any hot takes for the last little while either&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I was thinking about it, writing this stuff, even if nobody reads it, is probably a good thing, right? Like it's basically a diary and whatnot, and I feel like I read somewhere sometime that jotting down your thoughts was supposed to help, that obviously comes with a metric ton of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I will say though is I'm writing this a few days after the published date of this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Socialising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the past week there wasn't really any proper socialising to speak of, like there was games night on Sunday, Savage Rifts is still on hiatus and we're playing Only War, it's been quite enjoyable so far, the last couple of sessions have been leading up to a mass battle so to speak, I feel like so far we've done relatively well, but I have no idea how many waves the GM is planning at throwing at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that it's been mostly a quiet week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work has been interesting, a lot of the current projects are getting into the proper swing of things now and managing them while working my tasks is a new experience for me, lately I feel like I've maybe been dedicating too much time to management type items rather than my major task on hand, but there's been a bunch of other jobs here and there eating up my time, all the jobs need to get done though so it's not a major issue currently. Ultimately I think I might need to take a little bit of time just to clear out and possibly deploy everything that I have in current development and reprioritise everything else so I have a clear action plan for the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal Development &amp;amp; Leisure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't actually do much of anything I was planning on doing that I mentioned in my last blog. No Perl, no Lisp, but a tiny bit of C++. I think that was mostly a motivation thing this week, I did however look certification/training from places like Amazon and Microsoft etc. I'm still not sure if I'm actually going to do any of it, but it's something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I didn't do as much PD as I was expecting to this week is I spent a good solid chunk of Saturday (when I usually do that kind of stuff) playing Axiom Verge, it's a game I've had for years, started up when I first bought it and then more or less never touched it again. It's a metroidvania, with not much of the "vania", I guess I'll write this for a general audience, "metroidvania" is a genre of video games which are a cross between the "Metroid" and "Castlevania" series. I've only ever played the first level of the first Castlevania game so I can't speak too much to that, and Super Metroid is the Metroid game I'm most familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a basic level, in Super Metroid you start the game off quite "weak" and with only a few options in what you can do, as you progress through the game you pick up power ups which either make you able to take on stronger and stronger enemies or unlock new places to go in the game world, one of the big draws for me personally with this style of game is the backtracking through places you've already been and finding new paths/items you missed on your first (or latter) time through. Also, the feeling that as you get better as a player your character gets stronger which isn't exactly intended, it's just a side affect of the natural progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to Axiom Verge however, it feels very much like a homage to Super Metroid (almost to the point of being a clone), with a few bits and pieces added which do make it feel fresh and interesting. If I were to have one complaint, it's that mobility around the world feels less, I guess, fluid than it does in Super Metroid, the most recent powerup I got before I stopped playing on Saturday was a grappling hook, which while a welcome addition, feels more clunky and harder to use than the one in Super Metroid, admittedly, the one in Super Metroid can only be used in very specific locations while this one in Axiom Verge appears to be usable pretty much anywhere there's a ceiling. The ability to wall jump if you have good timing is something I also miss in Axiom Verge, I was never particularly good at wall jumping, but it often helped if I messed up a jump I wouldn't fall all the way down to the beginning. Now don't get me wrong, it's still been a very enjoyable game, and so far I'd reccommend it, but above it I'd reccommend Super Metroid itself or Ori and the Blind Forest (another Metroidvania, with an absolutely gorgious art style)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This Blog &amp;amp; Hot Takes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't mention this in the personal development section because I felt it would fit better in this part here. I've started to redesign the theme of this blog, I've made minimal progress on it so far because it took me far longer than it should have to find where the default theme came from. (I quite like the default theme, so that's why I'm more going to make my own modifications to it, rather than start from scratch) I may of missed something but I got the default theme from the github repository for Pelican itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I could be an Australian, be involved in tech and not be staunchly against the &lt;a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6195"&gt;Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018&lt;/a&gt;. In short, it's basically the Australian Government implimenting a law which forces companies to assist law enforcement breaking users encryption on their data and messages. My major concerns with it are that the wording of the bill from what I understand doesn't actually mean that you need to be under investigation for anything, just tangentally involved in an investigation, I'll leave that to the reader to think of how far that could be stretched. If you are involved in an investigation, law enforcement can ask for access and the company could face financial penalties for refusing to assist. The second one which honestly worries me more is that the bill effectively allows the government to approach an individual developer and compel them to do effectively alter the software, and just letting their boss know what's going on is a crime which can result in jail time. I don't know how this works with rejected code reviews or anything along those lines, but it's definitely something to keep an eye on. All of this also seems to have very little oversight on top of that as well, because of course. Sorry to end on a bit of a down note, but it's something that I needed to mention&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so I'm going to try and actually write stuff for this blog, I don't know how many times I've said that, but now that it's got my actual name attached to it, maybe I'll actually do it this time. There's not a lot for me to talk about really, but lets go for it anyway, also I have this titled week ending, but that doesn't mean these will be weekly, probably more likely fortnightly or maybe monthly, or maybe when I actually have stuff to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Socialising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past couple of weeks has been pretty social actually, there was a thank you lunch for the CSSC a bit over a week or so ago, Christmas Lunch for work last week and there was "Crate Day" yesterday (at the time that I started writing this) which ended up more just being a pool party, but it was all pretty good honestly. I'm still to work out exactly when I'm going down south to see the Busselton guys, but currently it'll probably just around Christmas, timing will be a bit of a challenge seeing Ki and I are hosting Christmas this year for the immediate family and I've got from the 21st through to the 2nd of January. I guess I'll keep this blog updated with what actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not actually sure if/what exactly I can/should write about in this section because NDA and whatnot. I guess I'll just speak generally from my own point of view, which is a bit difficult when it's just going online. Lately I've been doing a lot of behind the scenes changes, reducing what technical debt we've aquired over the last little while, adding in checks to increase resilience, that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one of the things I always do is work on personal development, like I alluded to in my previous post, I tend to pick up many small projects in different languages, but only a small number of them actually reach completion. But on what I've been looking into lately - I haven't really had that much of a project that I'm working on besides helping a friend with coding a fan game project, maybe I'll talk about that some other time. In terms of actual PD, I've continued to teach myself how LISP sort of works, I've also looked a little bit into doing some perl and reminding myself how C kind of operates, maybe C++ when I touch C. I think for the time being I'll stick with mucking about with LISP in terms of new / infrequently used languages. And last but not least actually set up this server, and blog with pelican probably counts as personal development and finally getting back around to setting up github pages, which is pretty neat with pelican actually, you can check this blog's dev branch on github and you'll see that I've added to my make file an option to automatically publish to github. I'll probably add a make target to create a new file, maybe automatic with filling out the date and whatnot. I guess we'll see&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This Blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, I've decided I'll probably start doing stuff like this with the subtitles and stuff, it'll mean I can sort of get my ideas in at least a somewhat organised way. but like everything, this idea might get abandoned by the next time I write this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Anton Savill, at the time of writing this I am in my mid-twenties, married and work as a software engineer. This website will probably get promptly forgotten about like most of my other projects I've worked on over the years. One day I might make my 'side projects' folder public on github, but for now you'll just have to trust me when I say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular server is running on a Vultr instance, I have VentaCP installed to manage the actual server side of things and I've set up Pelican to act as my static site generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yeah, that's about it for now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry></feed>
