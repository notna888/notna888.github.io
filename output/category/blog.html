</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1>Song Challenge Thing</h1>
<p>So my wife found this picture last month which is one of those 31 day song challenge things where you list off a different song each day and I was intending on posting it for my July post, but I forgot about it until literally 2 minutes ago so I thought I'd fire up my text editor and do it now, although as my music collection on my computer is literally weeks long I might take a while to actually post this... I have friends who's thing is like television shows or movies or books, I guess my thing is music.</p>
<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p><em>A song you like with a color in the title:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA52uNzx7Y4">Blue (Da Ba Dee) - Eiffel 65</a> and my wife put Paint It Black by the Rolling Stones, two types of people I guess.</p>
<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p><em>A song with a number in the title:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJq9y9xPKWs">10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2) - Tool</a> I sort of put this in originally as a throw away, but looking into the background of this song, now when I listen to it I get slightly tingly.</p>
<h2>Day 3</h2>
<p><em>A song that reminds you of summer time:</em> I'm not entirely sure why I associate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO2b3cggqs0">Zebra - John Butler Trio</a> with summer, but it's just something that's always been with me, even if some of the other songs in this list are more "summer-y"</p>
<h2>Day 4</h2>
<p><em>A song that reminds you of someone you'd rather forget:</em> This one's a bit of a hard one for me because I don't really have anyone I'd rather forget... I guess the closest I've got to this is: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiAuAJBZuGs">Crush - Tessa Violet</a></p>
<h2>Day 5</h2>
<p><em>A song that needs to be played loud:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fVE8kSM43I">Duality - Slipknot</a> It's a Slipknot song that's not one of their ballads. It's probably a crime not to play it loud.</p>
<h2>Day 6</h2>
<p><em>A song that makes you want to dance:</em> I don't really dance, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WOKk1i_eL8">Bae City Rollaz (w​/​ИΔΤVИ) - YUNG BAE</a> always makes me bop along.</p>
<h2>Day 7</h2>
<p><em>A song to drive to:</em> Okay, so this one deserves it's own little story, back when one of my best mates first got on his P's he came and picked me up to go for a drive. Obviously being two mid to late teenagers we were playing heavy stuff, some rap, drum and bass, all that kind of high energy stuff, and the first thing I played when he ran out of suggestions of what he wanted me to play, I played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dYNttdgl0">Spring - Vivaldi</a> mostly as a joke and a change of pass but as we were going down these back roads of my hometown it just suited the mood so well, the triumphant tones, and while I didn't realise it at the time, the joys of youth I guess. To this day, whenever I go for a drive with him, we always reminisce on that time. I really must take some time off and organise to hang out with him some time.</p>
<h2>Day 8</h2>
<p><em>A song about drugs or alcohol:</em> I'm like 90% sure that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trGX3ET3jTQ">Dr. Feelgood</a> is actually about drugs. (Edit: after watching the video for this song, it's 100% about drugs, no doubt about it.)</p>
<h2>Day 9</h2>
<p><em>A song that makes you happy:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8dsvclf3Tk">Mr. Blue Sky - Electric Light Orchestra</a> It really couldn't of been anything else, right?</p>
<h2>Day 10</h2>
<p><em>A song that makes you sad:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GkVhgIeGJQ">Boys don't cry - The Cure</a> - This one took me forever to work out because generally songs don't make me feel sad in of themselves, but the cure always holds this strange place for me. When I think of them I always come to the fact that they have their really love-y type songs, and then they have their darker side, both of which I adore for the record.</p>
<h2>Day 11</h2>
<p><em>A song that you never tire of:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypkv0HeUvTc">The Beautiful People - Marilyn Manson</a> I'm not entirely sure why this one in particular, it might be how percussive it is, that being said I'm a sucker for Drop D tuning.</p>
<h2>Day 12</h2>
<p><em>A song from your preteen years:</em> It's not exactly from my preteen years, I mean it is from my early teen years when I heard it, but I'd probably have to go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPIsh721z5c">Even - Simon Day</a>. It's from the move "The Black Balloon", which is up there as one of my favourite films, favourite probably isn't the right word, but it's certainly one of the movies I consider the most important to me at the very least. Either that or if we're strictly going preteen, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtQHIv2O8x0">Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head - Gorillaz</a></p>
<h2>Day 13</h2>
<p><em>A song you like from the 70's:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFrGuyw1V8s">Dancing Queen - ABBA</a> but there's so many others I could've picked it's not even a joke.</p>
<h2>Day 14</h2>
<p><em>A song you'd love to be played at your wedding:</em> I mean, I think really the only song I actually cared about being played at some point during my wedding was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TX_W_CMwT8">Daybreak - Michael Haggins</a> , which we did as my wife and I were signing the papers to make the marriage official and all that.</p>
<h2>Day 15</h2>
<p><em>A song you like that's a cover by another artist:</em> This one was giving me so much trouble because I couldn't think of a cover that I know that I prefer the cover to the original, I still for the most part like covers most bands do, just preference and whatnot. Then I remembered that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXlULkwhgrc">Jolene - The White Stripes</a> exists. I sort of prefer the studio version, but I think this live version distils exactly what it is about this one that I prefer over the Dolly Parton one. This one feels more like they've already lost and their pleading for things to be different, where the original, while still very much pleading, still has a level of hope at things being able to be salvaged, if that makes sense. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.</p>
<h2>Day 16</h2>
<p><em>A song that's a classic favourite:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq-gYOrU8bA">You can call me Al - Paul Simon</a> - Lets be real, most of the songs in this list could probably be considered classic favourites.</p>
<h2>Day 17</h2>
<p><em>A song you'd sing a duet with someone on karaoke:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsUGxcvn8yw">My Eyes - Neil Patrick Harris and Felicia Day</a> - From Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.</p>
<h2>Day 18</h2>
<p><em>A song from the year you were born:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25QyCxVkXwQ">Can you feel the love tonight - Elton John</a></p>
<h2>Day 19</h2>
<p><em>A song that makes you think about life:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pgum6OT_VH8">Starlight - Muse</a> It'd be remiss of me not to include at least one Muse song somewhere in this list.</p>
<h2>Day 20</h2>
<p><em>A song that has many meanings to you:</em> Right, so I couldn't really think of what to put here, but I ended up with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBsIHIIdQFA">Analogue Bubblebath - AFX</a>. It doesn't so much have many meanings to me, but when I listen to it, it always makes me feel a whole wash of emotions, I'm not even too sure how to explain it besides the first time I listened to it, it brought me to tears and I kind of just had to sit there for another half hour after this little 4 minute and change song had finished. Richard James has so many aliases I'm not even completely sure AFX is the right one for this song, but I'm pretty sure he was going by that when he released this album, so that's what I've put it as.</p>
<h2>Day 21</h2>
<p><em>A song you like with a person's name in the title:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObzgUfCl28">Ruby - Kaiser Chiefs</a> I completely forgot about this song until I went looking through my collection for names. I also forgot how great a song this one is.</p>
<h2>Day 22</h2>
<p><em>A song that moves you forwards:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OO9LloDSJo">Things can only get better - Howard Jones</a> Besides the title being endlessly optimistic, the lyrics in of themselves can always have a positive impact I guess.</p>
<h2>Day 23</h2>
<p><em>A song you think everyone should listen to:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IsSpAOD6K8">Once in a lifetime - Talking Heads</a> Which is probably one of my favourite songs I've stumbled back upon in the last few years. If nothing else the dance moves in the video clip for this song are worth it on it's own.</p>
<h2>Day 24</h2>
<p><em>A song by a band you wish were still together:</em> This one was a hard one for me because most of the bands that come to mind have actually come back together, like to list some that I had to double check, Rage Against the Machine, LCD Soundsystem, Pendulum, plus some that would probably be finished if they hadn't broken up when they had like The Clash and whatnot. So I sort of have to fall back to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6EQAOmJrbw">Teenagers - The Black Parade</a></p>
<h2>Day 25</h2>
<p><em>A song you like by an artist no longer living:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRCgKWOdu-g">Billy the Mountain - Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention</a> The longest "song" on this list coming in at a whopping 28+ minutes. It's more a story than a song at this point, but I'm the one writing this and I make the rules here. At the start he mentions when they played it previously, and that fanatics will know exactly where they've changed things. I know exactly where they changed things. I'm a bit torn on whether I prefer this one of the other.</p>
<h2>Day 26</h2>
<p><em>A song that makes you want to fall in love:</em> Probably has to go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVpv8-5XWOI">Hey, Soul Sister - Train</a></p>
<h2>Day 27</h2>
<p><em>A song that breaks your heart:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZdEeBdkYh4">Valence - Habadashary</a> - I feel kinda bad linking this one because it was on 99 views and it was uploaded 9 years ago. That being said, as I said in my last blog post, the reason this one is so special to me is for me and one other person, so only 99 views makes sense in a way...</p>
<h2>Day 28</h2>
<p><em>A song by an artist whose voice you love:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec6p9GwASC0">Satellite Mind - Metric</a> - I've picked the acoustic version here, but honestly I could've put a metric song for a bunch of these days. I really do feel like this band is a bit of a hidden gem.</p>
<h2>Day 29</h2>
<p><em>A song you remember from your childhood:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk7N3dhzM1o">Hello - The Cat Empire</a> I distinctly remember for about a week or two straight I heard this song multiple times a day, just out and about in different situations, I think it was also on a T.V. ad, which didn't help, but there's a special spot for this song.</p>
<h2>Day 30</h2>
<p><em>A song that reminds you of yourself:</em> Took me a while to work out this one specifically because there's so many other songs on this list that remind me of me, It's one of the reasons I listen to these songs... I finally settled on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lyu1KKwC74">Bitter Sweet Symphony - The Verve</a></p>
<h2>Day 31</h2>
<p><em>A song that comforts your soul:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3J_2R9rAp8">Fearless - Pink Floyd</a> Ever since I first head this song back when I was probably about 9 years old it has been my favourite song of all time. I might one day go into much more detail on why this song in particular, but looking at the categories probably over half of these could've just been this. If I have one request it's to have this song played at my funeral.</p>
<h2>And that's it.</h2>
<p>Well, this took me much longer than I was expecting to write, but it's done now, and I can push this up. I'll probably throw together a normal blog post some time in the next week, but until then, I'll catchya around.</p>
<p>p.s. tweet at me on twitter if you do this list. I kind really quite like these kind of things.</p>                </article>
