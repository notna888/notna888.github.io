# Is this thing on?

I guess if you're reading this, that's a yes.
Just like everyone else on the planet who has a blog, here's an awkward and exceedingly short first post.

My name is Anton Savill, at the time of writing this I am in my mid-twenties, married and work as a software engineer. This website will probably get promptly forgotten about like most of my other projects I've worked on over the years. One day I might make my 'side projects' folder public on github, but for now you'll just have to trust me when I say that.

This particular server is running on a Vultr instance, I have VentaCP installed to manage the actual server side of things and I've set up Pelican to act as my static site generation.

And yeah, that's about it for now.
