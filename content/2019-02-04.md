So it's been about 2 months since my last post. In my defence it's not really my fault, I'll get into that below.

## I moved!
A big part of the reason I haven't been posting is because I've been in the process of moving. I will miss the old place, I posted a semi-long status on facebook talking about it, I wont really repeat it here, I'll just say after living there for near on 5 years I grew really used to the place, I'm really beginning to settle into the new place, I can find myself around with the lights off and that's how I know I've basically got it down pat :)

## Work
Work's been quite good. Quite stressful with a lot of the ongoing projects, but good none the less. Having my two interns helping me with it

## Personal Development
Stuff about lisp and arithmetic shift

## Shows I'm currently watching
House, Andromeda

## Game night
end of only war

### Thanks for reading, I'll catchya next time :)
