# First post of 2022

Hello there! I didn't intend not to post for the entirety of 2021, but it was quite a year for me. 2020 was a pretty big year for me with a decent number of personal life changes, 2021 was a year I set aside to just sort myself out and what I want to do. (Which of course is easier said than done)

One small thing I guess is that I've decided to retire Seagull and PyLaridae, I misjudged how much free time I would have to work on the projects. I would like to go back to them eventually

There's not a lot I really wanted to say directly besides that I'm planning on changing how I am hosting this blog. Currently it's running vestacp on a vultr server. Nothing particularly wrong with it of course, but it's overkill for what I need. When I get to doing this I'll be writing up a post about how I do it. I'm thinking of using github pages and putting cloudflare in front of it.

Until next time, cheers :)
