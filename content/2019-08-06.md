# Song Challenge Thing

So my wife found this picture last month which is one of those 31 day song challenge things where you list off a different song each day and I was intending on posting it for my July post, but I forgot about it until literally 2 minutes ago so I thought I'd fire up my text editor and do it now, although as my music collection on my computer is literally weeks long I might take a while to actually post this... I have friends who's thing is like television shows or movies or books, I guess my thing is music.

## Day 1
*A song you like with a color in the title:* [Blue (Da Ba Dee) - Eiffel 65](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA52uNzx7Y4)
## Day 2
*A song with a number in the title:* 10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2) - Tool (Not on youtube, but is on spotify as of like a few days ago)
## Day 3
*A song that reminds you of summer time:* I'm not entirely sure why I associate [Zebra - John Butler Trio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO2b3cggqs0) with summer, but it's just something that's always been with me, even if some of the other songs in this list are more "summer-y"
## Day 4
*A song that reminds you of someone you'd rather forget:* This one's a bit of a hard one for me because I don't really have anyone I'd rather forget... I guess the closest I've got to this is: [Crush - Tessa Violet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiAuAJBZuGs)
## Day 5
*A song that needs to be played loud:* [Duality - Slipknot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fVE8kSM43I)
## Day 6
*A song that makes you want to dance:* I don't really dance, but [Bae City Rollaz (w​/​ИΔΤVИ) - YUNG BAE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WOKk1i_eL8) always makes me bop along.
## Day 7
*A song to drive to:* Okay, so this one deserves it's own little story, back when one of my best mates first got on his P's he came and picked me up to go for a drive. Obviously being two mid to late teenagers we were playing heavy stuff, some rap, drum and bass, all that kind of high energy stuff, and the first thing I played when he ran out of suggestions of what he wanted me to play, I played [Spring - Vivaldi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dYNttdgl0) and as we were going down these back roads of my hometown it just suited the mood so well, the triumphant tones, and while I didn't realise it at the time, the joys of youth I guess. To this day, whenever I go for a drive with him, we always reminisce on that time. I really must take some time off and organise to hang out with him some time.
