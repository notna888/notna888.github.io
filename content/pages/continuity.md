# In Case of Incapacity
So being the sort of person I am, and with heavy influence of [Eric Raymond's Continuity Page](http://www.catb.org/~esr/continuity.html) I thought I'd add a sort of will to my personal webpage.

I know Eric Raymond has made a significantly larger impact to the world of tech than yours truly, but I intend on keeping this page up to date as it is a wish of mine to make useful software that's available for anyone to use, but there's no saying if I'll get hit by a bus tomorrow.

As such this is in effect my Last Will and Testament and any published before the date of this document shall be considered null and void with the exception of showing that this document still reflects my wishes. I am aware it is not a legally binding contract due to the fact that as this is a digital document and as such cannot be signed by witnesses. This simply exists to lay out my wishes in plain English. A signed paper copy should be in the possession of my wife, what is written here is my most up to date wishes.


## Desired distribution
This lays out my desired distribution of any monetary wealth I may of had upon my death.

*My mother and little brother (Lesley and William Savill): 80-90%

*Dad: 10%

In addition to above:
*I would appreciate a portion - ideally no more than 10% of my residual estate to be set aside for grief counselling to friends and co-workers close to me, especially if my death was sudden and unexpected. If a friend is able to present written proof of me owing them a formal debt to a maximum of $500 (unless specifically mentioned as an amendment to my digital will)

In the case of where these percentages cannot be distributed to my wishes I would like to fall back to leaving my entire estate behind to my next-of-kin, Lesley Savill, my mother for distribution at her discretion.



For any software on my github or other publicly available source control / distribution site that she is unsure on who would be best to transfer it to I'd like to nominate my long time friend Harry White.
