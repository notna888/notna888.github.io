# Blog Post 2019-10-07

## Last month recap.

Another whole month and it's gone by so quickly, I didn't even actually realise until a few days ago that it wasn't August anymore. i.e. I completely missed September (and the first week of October it seems). If I'm completely honest I don't really think I've done *that* much, I mean, I feel like I've been productive and gotten things done when they've needed to be done, it's just gone by without me noticing. Now I'm not sure if this is a side effect of me settling into a routine of just consistent output instead of my more burst/downtime type workflow I used to have or something else. It might be even though I've had some notable things the last month, the fact that I always keep myself busy means I haven't had a chance to properly reflect, which is what this blog is for at the end of the day I guess.

I've also decided unless it's something worth writing about I don't think I will actually write about it. For example, this month it's been business as usual at work, so besides this brief mention here, I don't think I'll touch on it like I have in previous blogs.

## Royal Show
So I went to the Perth Royal Show with my wife this weekend, it was quite nice just to spend some time with her, and I think honestly this will be mostly what I talk about here. I wasn't ever really one for the show. it was something I'd do occasionally as my friends would be going and when I was a child, but even then, it was always the local show, not the one here in the city. Maybe I'm jaded in my "old age" but I don't think the show is really something for me, I'll go there with my wife for her as she quite enjoys it, and when I eventually have children I see myself bringing them to the show too, but it's not really something for me, if that makes sense.

I mean, down in my hometown we had a show that would run for one evening and one day (Friday/Saturday) and besides I think once or twice, every year we didn't go to see the fireworks, it didn't really matter to my family growing up - for us a family outing was more something like going to the trots or going out fishing
