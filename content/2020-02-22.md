# Another Post
Another time me saying how unbelievably busy I've been.

There's not honestly a lot to say. I've finally added my "continuity" page, it's protected with a password, but if anyone like looks at the github they can find the password, It's nothing special, I just feel like I prefer to have that with some level of encryption, I don't know.

Other than that, same old same old, looking at a bunch of houses to move from where we currently are.

I know this is a bit of a lackluster first post for 2020, and for the decade, but that's how it goes.

### Anyway, that's me for now, I'll see if I can write more for the next post. Cheers
