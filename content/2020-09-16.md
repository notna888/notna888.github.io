# Short Update

Mostly making this post because I've decided I'm going to at least update this blog twice a week.

That being said, this is more a non-update because I haven't really done any work on PyLaridae, that being said I've decided I'm going to spend some time working on an SPA with a django backend. Even when I decide to commit to a project fully I go off and do something else, neat.

This one is something I've been thinking about for a while though, VueJS really caught my fancy and I've been trying to think of a reason to use it... It probably wont really turn out like a Single Page App, but Progressive Web App might be more in the sort of range of things I do, maybe, we'll see.

### That's it for this post, catchya next time
